<h1> A Fylo-landing-page </h1>

<p> This is a little project that I left incomplete earlier when I started learning to code but left it for a while due to my lack of patience 😂. 
  <br> Fast-forword, I have gotten better and I have still not found the time for it 😪 
  <br> because it is quite difficult to go back to a previous project without company 👩🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏾 </p>
