<h1> A Fylo-landing-page </h1>

<p> This is a little project that I left incomplete earlier when I started learning to code but left it for a while due to my lack of patience 😂. 
  <br> Fast-forword, I have gotten better and I have still not found the time for it 😪 
  <br> because it is quite difficult to go back to a previous project without company 👩🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏾 </p>
  
  <h2><i> Important to note that this work has lots of bugs that needs fixing </i></h2>
  
  <h3> So Feel Free </h3>
  - Add Crazy Features 
  - Make it very responsive 
  - Have fun!
   
   By doing this, you are improving yourself and you could add this as a nice project for resume
   This is for Beginners or if you want to have fun.
